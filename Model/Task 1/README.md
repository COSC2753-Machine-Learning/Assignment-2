To run the scripts, make sure to organize the files as follows:

```
. <--- (root directory)
|
+---Furniture_Data
|       
+---Model
    |
    +---Task 1
        |
        +---classifier.py
        |           
        +---models.py
        |           
        +---README.md
        | 
        +---resnet_state_dict.pth
        | 
        +---resnet.pth
        | 
        +---RestNet.ipynb
        | 
        +---vgg16_state_dict.pth
        | 
        +---VGG16.ipynb
        | 
        +---vgg16.pth
```
